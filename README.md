EverStrong

EverStrong is a smart training app designed for long-term progress and longevity.
It adapts daily sessions to your recovery score and balances strength, endurance, and resilience.

Core Idea
- Every day, you enter your recovery score.
- Based on this score, EverStrong selects the best training option for that day.
- This ensures progress without overtraining, and keeps the focus on long-term health.

Training Engines
EverStrong works with three main training engines:
- Kettlebell — strength, power, and conditioning.
- Barbell — maximal strength and progressive overload.
- Bodyweight — mobility, control, and resilience.

Extras
- HIIT sessions for short, high-intensity work.
- Zone 2 cardio for endurance and heart health.
- Breathing and Durability flows for recovery and mobility.

Key Features
- Daily auto-generated sessions based on recovery.
- History tracking: view all previous workouts.
- Exercise cards: each workout shows movement icons and lets you note the load you used.
- Cycle logic: workouts are structured in training blocks that balance intensity, volume, and recovery.
- Dark & light mode: a clean, minimal interface that works on any device.

How to Use
1. Check your recovery — assess sleep, energy, and body signals to give yourself a daily recovery score.
2. Open EverStrong — the app generates the best workout for your current recovery level.
3. Train — follow the suggested session (kettlebell, barbell, bodyweight, HIIT, or cardio).
4. Log your progress — note down weights, reps, or adjustments in the exercise cards.
5. Repeat daily — consistency leads to sustainable progress and long-term resilience.

Philosophy

EverStrong is not just about lifting heavier or going faster.
It’s about sustainable strength — training that you can do every day, for years to come.
The app balances hard training with active recovery, so users keep making progress while staying healthy, mobile, and strong for life.
